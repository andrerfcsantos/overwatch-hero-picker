      About this site
    </h2>

    <p class="paragraph-text">
      When playing Overwatch, we all had those moments where we are unsure about
      which hero to play.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph-text">
      In those moments you may want a hero to be chosen for you! But more often
      than not, you don't want the hero chosen to be completely random. It would
      be nice if the random selection was between heroes you actually want to
      play.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph-text">
      That's where this site comes in. Just select the heroes you want to play
      and get a random one from that selection. You can also use this site to
      select heroes you are not confortable playing and get a random one to
      try/improve.
    </p>

      Why another Hero Picker?
    </h2>

    <p class="paragraph-text">
      There are several other random hero pickers/generators for Overwatch, but
      I found most of them too be either too simple - without the option to
      filter heroes - or too complicated. With this hero picker, I tried to make
      something simple but useful.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph-text">
      The majority of other hero pickers I tried also have ads. This is an
      annoyance, especially on mobile devices. To ensure the smoothest
      experience possible, this site has no ads and I have no intention to add
      them in the future.
